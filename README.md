# UserManagement_WebApp

This is a coding task using Symfony 4.4 for a Backend/PHP interview

### Notes

- I've kept the front end as minimal as possible while being functional (simple structure, no styling) as this was not the focus of the task.
- As the description of the task named diferent user roles, I implemented authentication and added email and password to User for that purpouse.
- Has non existent error handling nor automated testing, given the time this should be adressed.
